# Get Eggs

This script automates getting eggs from the daycare man.

## Setup

Before starting the script, stand directly to the left of the daycare man (you can use the d-pad to get back on the grid).

## Keep in Mind

* Make sure you don't have any eggs in your party
* The received eggs will fill your boxes starting at the first slot of box 1, you may want to move boxes around before eggs fill in random gaps
* The timing is optimized for saves with the Oval Charm and breeding with a Ditto that gets along with the other pokemon
