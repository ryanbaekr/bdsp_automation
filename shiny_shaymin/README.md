# Shiny Shaymin

This script automates finding a shiny shaymin encounter.

## Setup

Before starting the script, start a battle with shaymin, wait for the battle menu to appear, and then hit the home button.

## Keep in Mind

* The RECORD_SECONDS and THRESHOLD values may need to be modified for your setup, the default values worked for me on a Switch 2 with audio captured by an Elgato H60 Pro
* It is important to minimize as much sound as possible, set music and pokemon cry volumes to 0, leave sound effect volume at 8
* Likewise, ideally your lead should not have an ability that automatically activates (such as intimidate)
