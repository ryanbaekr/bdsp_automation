# Hatch Eggs

This script automates hatching eggs.

## Setup

Before starting the script, make sure your boxes open to the first box of eggs you want to hatch. Make sure you are on your bike in high gear on the long path in Solaceon Town (that has all the ramps).

## Keep in Mind

* You must have 5 eggs in your party that will hatch at the same time
* The one pokemon in your party must be in slot 1
* The eggs in your boxes must take the same number of steps to hatch
* Your egg boxes must be full and all next to each other
* The timing is optimized for eggs that hatch at 5100 steps
* All trainers on the path must already be defeated
